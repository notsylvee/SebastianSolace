Whenever you die, you'll be brought here, and I'll show you a document detailing what caused your *oh so early* demise.

I don't really feel like going into detail about whats gonna happen here since, *apparently*, you already know how to counter most of the threats here, or maybe you just got really, REALLY lucky for a first timer, *but I doubt that.* Alright. Let me find what caused your... Ah. Here we go." },

The next time you inevitably fail, and get sent back down again, you'll have the opportunity to stock up on some useful supplies, assuming you have funds for it of course. I've *been forced to* set up a system that'll allow you to order supplies whilst you are still aboard the submarine, all of which will be conveniently awaiting you in a crate at its destination.

You give me any research you might have on you, and i'll give you some of these items ive scavenged. Here, you can just, pick it off my tail. These would be far more useful to you, compared to some '*silly data*', no? If you don't ask questions, I won't either. You get yours, and I get mine.
